# at-sre-challenge

This repository contains the code for the SRE challenge at AirTasker.

The project is using Go for the simple backend service. This allows us to have a lightweight Docker
image, and less importantly for this challenge, an efficient and performant service.

We're using chi as the HTTP router, which is a lightweight and idiomatic router for Go.
